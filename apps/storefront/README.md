# Hydrogen Storefront (MVP)

This app will implement the MVP Hydrogen React storefront for the horse/equine Shopify store described in `docs/prd.md`.

## Planned MVP Scope
- Header + nav + footer per PRD (Shop by Role, Shop by Category, Shop by Use Case).
- Collection (PLP) pages for key categories: tack, grooming, barn & stable, rider, training.
- PDP layout with images, key attributes, sizing/fit section, and related products.
- Cart page and checkout handoff to the Shopify dev store `mydevstore-8182`.

## Next Steps
- Scaffold a Hydrogen application in this directory (e.g. using Shopify Hydrogen templates).
- Wire environment variables for the dev store domain and Storefront API token (not committed).
- Implement the IA, PLP, PDP, and cart/checkout flows per `docs/prd.md`.
